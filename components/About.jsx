            Welcome to my portfolio! I&apos;m just a guy who likes to code. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be
            websites, applications, or anything in between. My goal is to always
            build something meaningful that brings value.
            <br />
            <br />I started my career in the hospitality industry, but I have
            always had a passion for technology and design. I decided to make the
            switch into development and haven&apos;t looked back!
